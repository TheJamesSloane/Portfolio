Neville's comment on the beans listing:
I tried a Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Bean once... thought it was toffee, but it turned out to be earwax. Haven't quite trusted them since.

Harry's response: 
Yeah, Neville, I’ve had a few bad ones too. But that’s sort of the point, isn’t it? Makes it more of an adventure.
